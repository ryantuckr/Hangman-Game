..create a list of words, store in an array
..create a list of user inputs, store in an array
..load 10 lives/guesses

get user input/guess, store user guesses in an array?
check to see if a is somewhere in the hiddenWord   
    if true reveal the hidden letter in the correct posistion of hiddenWord
    if this is false remove a life, maybe change the text/backgroud color (could be a different function)
    
   ?? if user input completes the word, alert you win - different function?
   ?? If user input = hiddenWord alert you win?

dispay user guesses via innerhtml.getelementbyid.

if lives = 0 prompt game over, do you want to play again?
    yes = reset/reload page/rerandomize hiddenWord
            lives = 10
    false = thanks for playing



    somehow try and block second guesses on the same letter -lives
